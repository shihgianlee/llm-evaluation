    "### [BLEU](https://huggingface.co/spaces/evaluate-metric/bleu)\n",
    "* BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) is a metric originally designed for evaluating machine translation models by comparing generated text to reference translations. It measures the overlap of n-grams between the generated output and the reference texts while applying a brevity penalty to discourage excessively short translations. BLEU ranges from 0 to 1, where a higher score indicates better similarity to the reference.\n",

    "* n-gram:\n",

    "  - If we have two sentences \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog. It was a sunny day.\" (Reference) and \"The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\" (Candidate), BLEU would yield a good scores on what it does extract, but it won't effectively punish it for what it fails to extract.\n",

    "* BLEU scores are not comparable across different datasets, nor are they comparable across different languages.\n",

    "* BLEU scores can vary greatly depending on which parameters are used to generate the scores, especially when different tokenization and normalization techniques are used. It is therefore not possible to compare BLEU scores generated using different parameters, or when these parameters are unknown.

    "\n",
    "* Unlike BERTScore, ROUGE-N is not able to consider order, context, or semantics when calculating a score. Since it only relies on overlapping n-grams, it can not tell when a synonym is being used or if the placement of two matching n-grams have any meaning on the overall sentence. As a result, the metric may not be a perfect representation of the quality of the text, but rather the \"likeness\" of the n-grams in two sentences. Take for example, the ROUGE-2 score of \"This is an example of text\" and \"Is an example of text this\". Both ROUGE-1 and ROUGE-2 would give this a (nearly) perfect score, but the second sentence makes absolutely no sense!\n",
    "\n",
    "* ROUGE-N can not capture global coherence. Given a long paragraph, realistically, having too large of a value for N would not return a meaningful score for two sentences, but having a reasonable number like N = 3 wouldn't be able to capture the flow of the text. The score might yield good results, but the entire paragraph might not flow smoothly at all. This is a weakness of n-gram based metrics, as they are limited to short context windows.\n",

    "| **METEOR** | Precision + Recall | Machine Translation, LLM Evaluation, Paraphrase Detection | Uses **stemming, synonyms, paraphrases**, recall-weighted F-score, penalizes word order errors. |\n",
